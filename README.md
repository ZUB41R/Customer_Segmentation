# Customer_Segmentation

This is the third project submitted as part of completing the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). 

The objective of this project is to segment different types of customers a wholesale distributor deals with so that the distributor could set appropriate business strategy. to achieve this I have used different unsupervised learning techniques including Principal Component Analysis, Gaussian Mixture Model and K-Means clustering.
